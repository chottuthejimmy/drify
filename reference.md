## Regarding Draw

What happens is that, the program first detects whichever hand that it sees first and locks it, if it sees mutliple hands after this process it will not detect the other hands. This is because the program is designed to only detect one hand at a time.
If you want to draw with the other hand, you can remove the first hand or the hand that was locked and just put the other hand in front of the camera and the program will detect it and lock it.

The reason we have kept it this way is to address the point that different people have different dominant hands and we wanted to make sure that the program is able to detect the dominant hand of the user and lock it. :)
